# REGIONAL-COMPETITIVENESS-ANALYSIS-A-CASE-STUDY-ON-ITALY

## 1. Introduction
Competitiveness, as defined by the OECD, is the ability of a nation to produce goods and services that can compete internationally while increasing the real income of its population in a free market. The European Commission uses the Regional Competitiveness Index (RCI) to assess and quantify the competitiveness of regions in EU member states.

Italy's internal landscape is fragmented, with varying strengths and weaknesses across its regions. This project aims to analyze the indicators contributing to the RCI for Italy, focusing on data from 2022.

### Objectives
- Identify significant factors influencing regional competitiveness in Italy.
- Conduct a clustering analysis to group regions by competitiveness.
- Compare overall clustering with subgroup analyses for different macro-areas.

### Key Indicators
- **Technological Readiness**: Access to broadband, online purchases.
- **Business Sophistication**: Employment in K-N sectors, collaboration among SMEs.
- **Innovation**: Employment in creative sectors, research expenditure, patent applications.

## 2. Limitations of the RCI
The RCI provides a broad overview but lacks granularity for understanding individual regional challenges. While it may show that Southern regions are less competitive, it does not pinpoint specific areas needing intervention.

## 3. Importance of Detailed Analysis
To address disparities effectively, it's crucial to complement RCI data with detailed, region-specific analyses. This approach will help identify key areas for improvement and ensure targeted policy interventions.

## 4. Conclusion
The competitiveness landscape in Italy is complex, shaped by various interacting factors. Addressing disparities requires an integrated approach to enhance competitiveness in underperforming regions and sustain growth in more competitive areas.
